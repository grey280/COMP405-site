		<h1>General Information</h1>
		<p>There’s something about music that makes people think it is an inherent skill. Tell someone to try pottery, and they’ll give it a try despite never having done it before. And yet, do the exact same thing with music, and they’ll be quick to assure you that they don’t have the ‘knack’ for it.</p>
		<p>This is, however, not accurate. Seldom are there people with ‘natural’ musical talent - and even rarer are those who’ve become famous musicians. Musical performance is a learned skill, something that anyone is capable of if they’re willing to put in the effort.</p>
