<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p><hr><hr>
<h2>August 20, 2005</h2>
<p>Well, I've made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through somei nteresting places on the way:</p>
<ol><li>Walla Walla, WA</li><li>Magic City, ID</li><li>Bountiful, UT</li><li>Last Chance, CO</li><li>Why, AZ</li><li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li></ol>

<p>I saw some Burma-Shave style signs on the side of the road today.</p>
<blockquote>Passing cars,<br>When you can't see,<br>May get you,<br>A glimpse,<br>Of eternity.</blockquote>
<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, </p>
<blockquote>&quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.&quot;</blockquote>
