		<p>As the end of the Oregon Trail, the state has a rich history, fraught with stories of the hardship that the original settlers endured in order to reach their new homes.</p>
		<p>The relics of these travelers can be found throughout the state, from a full-fledged museum to the bleached bones of the animals that didn't survive the trip.</p>

		<p>The mountains throughout the state, from the Cascade Mountains to the Coastal Ranges, offer a range of activities, from skiing to hiking. Views such as the one shown here can be achieved after only a short hike, and indeed, many roads through the mountains offer overlook points to further demonstrate the natural beauty of the state.</p>

		<a href='creek.html'><img src='images/creek-thumb.jpg' alt='Photograph of a creek in a wooded area, with a small, natural-appearing stone dam creating a very small waterfall.'></a>
		<p>The simple beauty of nature can be found throughout the state, not just on the mountains or the coast. Take, for example, this tranquil creek, located in a park in Molalla. Publicly-accessible campsites sit along the side of the creek, and the soft bubbling of water can turn what some would call a pedestrian vacation into a relaxing paradise.</p>
